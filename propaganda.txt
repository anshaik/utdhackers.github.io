Hey guys, I am starting a club this semester with an upperclassman and @Benny called UTD Hackers.

If you're a computer science, computer engineering, or other kind of technology major, you may be interested in this club!

We are a club that goes to hackathons, which are weekend-long events where you build technology. That could be an app, a website, a robot, whatever. The point is to foster programming, creativity, and entrepreneurial skills which you will use in the future when you end up working.

If you're looking for a way to get cool San Francisco/New York internships (or even something local), a lot of companies sponsor these events to hire the motivated students that come to these kinds of events! Hackathons look really good on your resume, as they show that you are passionate about technology outside of the classroom.
